# AppleTree
A simple app for interacting with search trees. Made with C# and Unity in July 2017.

C# scripts are in Assets/Scripts. A Windows executable and an apk can be found in Build.

While the app could previously be found in the Google Play Store, it now seems to be gone.

Keystore file is private.
